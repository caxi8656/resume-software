# Interactive Animation, Python

Catherine Xie and Kai Franks

This program is an interactive animation that contains seven rows of colored circles. The rows are ordered by way
of a rainbow, from red to violet. The rows move with the mouse; if the cursor moves right the rows move right and 
"Mouse moving to the right" is printed out in the terminal. If the cursor moves left the rows move left and "Mouse
moving to the left" is printed in the terminal.

If the user clicks their mouse or presses the space bar, then the rows will flip from red to violet to violet to
red. If the user clicks their mouse or presses the space bar again the rows will flip back.

 * `Rainbow_Stream.py:` Contains the Python file.
